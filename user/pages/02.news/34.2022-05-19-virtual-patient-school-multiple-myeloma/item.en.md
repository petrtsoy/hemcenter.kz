Hematology Center is holding the first edition of the Patient School in its new format.

===

Hematologists Anton Klodzinsky, Meruert Sataeva, and Aliya Iskakova, the main speakers of the conference, have prepared their presentations based on questions submitted by patients. Those who did not manage to send their questions in advance will have the opportunity to ask them during the conference. If someone cannot join the School at the scheduled time, questions can be sent in advance via WhatsApp to the Patient Support Service (+7 777 079 3165); the doctors will try to address them. A recording of the School will be shared with everyone who wishes to receive it.

📅 Date & Time: May 19 at 18:30 (Almaty time)
