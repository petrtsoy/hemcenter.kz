![Dasatinib](Dasatinib.png "Dasatinib")

Dasatinib is a more potent drug compared to imatinib, but its side effects are usually more pronounced.
Common side effects include:
* Edema (swelling),
* Headaches,
* Fatigue,
* Cytopenias: decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia), decreased white blood cells (leukopenia), anemia (hematologic toxicity),
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (very common – 17–31%).
* Less common side effects may include:
* Heart rhythm disturbances (ECG monitoring with QT interval calculation and consideration of drug interactions is required),
* Gastrointestinal bleeding,
* Hemorrhages.

Dasatinib may also cause fluid retention, including pleural and pericardial effusions and pulmonary hypertension, and very frequently leads to edema.

This side effect is usually managed with diuretics; pleural puncture is required only in exceptional cases and is never indicated in patients with mild symptoms.
