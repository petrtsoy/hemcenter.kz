Specialist outreach visits from the National Scientific Center of Oncology and Transplantology (NSCOT) to the regions of Kazakhstan have begun. The first working group, led by the country’s Chief Freelance Hematologist Vadim Kemaykin, visited the Ust-Kamenogorsk branch of LLP “Hematology Center”, which has been working effectively with NSCOT since its opening.

The main purpose of these outreach visits—planned across all regions of Kazakhstan during April, May, and June this year—is to establish stronger cooperation between regional healthcare providers and the National Scientific Center of Oncology and Transplantology. NSCOT is expanding, with a new building under construction that will make it possible to increase the number of transplantations available to patients throughout Kazakhstan.

During the meeting with the staff of the East Kazakhstan branch, Vadim Kemaykin and members of the mobile team—NSCOT representatives Nurgul Azhdarova and Almira Zhukubaeva—emphasized that collaboration with the branch has been effective since its opening. They noted that cooperation has long been established and that the branch’s performance indicators (KPIs) continue to grow.

Before a patient in need of a transplantation is referred to the Center, they receive all necessary care: achieving remission, undergoing required examinations, as well as donor preparation. Since this year, the branch’s staff and NSCOT specialists have been holding weekly online discussions of patient cases scheduled for transplantation. This in-person meeting with the Center’s representatives became another important step towards ensuring that both current and future patients are provided with the best possible conditions in their fight for life.
