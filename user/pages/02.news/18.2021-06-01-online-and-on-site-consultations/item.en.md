Starting from June 1, 2021, we are opening registration for remote consultations.
Consultations are provided by hematologists and an oncologist.

===

Following the consultation, patients receive a medical report with recommendations.

You can register and choose the consultation format by phone or WhatsApp: +7 771 900 0864.

Types of consultations:

Asynchronous (deferred) consultation — without direct contact with a doctor, based on submitted medical documents; clarifying questions and answers are provided via WhatsApp.

Online real-time consultation — conducted via Zoom.

In-person consultations — available in Nur-Sultan, Karaganda, and Ust-Kamenogorsk.
