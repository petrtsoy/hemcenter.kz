The Hematology Center and the Kazakhstan Society of Hematologists NGO are actively engaged in dialogue with the authorities, contributing to the development of policies aimed at improving the quality of hematology care for patients with blood disorders and enhancing working conditions for medical professionals.

===

Today, a meeting was held in the [Mazhilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan](https://youtu.be/OG87gUBBjJQ?t=2680), where the Head of the Center, Irina Pivovarova, delivered an analysis of the challenges in the digitalization of medical services and provided recommendations for improving this process.

One of the key areas of digitalization is the implementation of remote services. In 2020, the Hematology Center provided 6,500 remote services to patients, which helped ensure the continuity of medical care during quarantine restrictions. In addition, remote consultations reduce waiting times for specialist care and give patients the opportunity to ask questions to their doctors on a deferred basis.

An interview with Irina A. Pivovarova can also be found in [Ulagatty Meditsina magazine](UM38.pdf).
