Hematology Center has developed and introduced a new format of patient care specifically for residents of Balkhash.

===

The mobile day hospital includes consultations, patient examinations, and diagnostic tests that were previously unavailable to patients from Balkhash and nearby settlements.

Over two days of work, Dr. Klodzinsky and Dr. Olifirovich examined patients and performed trephine biopsies, bone marrow aspirations, genetic testing, and blood coagulation factor level assessments. Previously, patients had to travel to the day hospital in Karaganda to undergo these procedures.

“My deepest gratitude to the team of doctors who worked in Balkhash today,” wrote patient O. in her feedback. “I was very anxious about the procedure, but the doctors’ attitude completely reassured me!”

“We have brought medical care closer to the region’s residents, and we hope to make this a permanent practice,” concluded Dr. Klodzinsky. “Depending on patient needs, we plan to continue visiting and providing high-quality diagnostics for those referred during in-person visits, online consultations, and hybrid consultations, which have already been operating in Balkhash for two months.”
