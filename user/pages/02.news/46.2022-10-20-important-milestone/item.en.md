Our colleague took part in the international nephrology congress “IMPORTANT MILESTONE: Conceptual Approaches and Key Directions of Multidimensional Nephrology,” which was recently held in Almaty and organized by the Public Foundation “National Kidney Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan.”

The event brought together nephrologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, hematologists, and primary care physicians from Turkey, Germany, Poland, Russia, and Belarus. One of the main topics of discussion focused on key interdisciplinary issues. Among the participants was Anton Anatolyevich Klodzinsky, PhD (Medicine), Medical Director of LLP “Hematology Center.” Together with nephrologists and transplant specialists, he discussed the diagnosis of certain hematological conditions associated with kidney diseases, such as multiple myeloma, primary amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance, and others.

“Such discussions are very valuable for our patients,” noted Dr. Klodzinsky. “On the one hand, the knowledge gained makes it possible to detect hematological diseases at an earlier stage; on the other, it improves the effectiveness of treating certain kidney diseases. Often, the cause of such conditions lies in blood disorders, which can be successfully treated in parallel by hematologists. Interdisciplinary communication and collaboration enrich hematologists, nephrologists, and physicians of other specialties — and ultimately, all of this serves the benefit of patients.”
