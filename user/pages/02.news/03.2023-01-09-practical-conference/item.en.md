In just a few words, this is how one can describe the large-scale scientific and practical conference attended by specialists from the Hematology Center.

===

“Multidisciplinary Approach in Hematopathology” — this was the title of the two-day conference organized by the NGO Kazakhstan Society of Hematologists. The event gathered 130 hematologists, pathologists, and nephrologists from across Kazakhstan. And that number only reflects those who attended in person — many others joined online.

The conference’s honorary guest was Prof. Vadim Valentinovich Baykov, Doctor of Medical Sciences and Acting Head of the Department of Pathological Anatomy at St. Petersburg State Medical University. He also led the pool of speakers, which included Kazakhstan’s Chief Freelance Hematologist Vadim Matveevich Kemaikin, President of the Kazakhstan Professional Society of Oncohematologists Raigul Mukhanbetovna Ramazanova, and the leadership of the Hematology Center — General Director Irina Alekseevna Pivovarova and Medical Director Anton Anatolyevich Klodzinsky.

This was already the second event organized by the Society focused on a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis of oncohematological diseases. The conference not only addressed a range of important issues in hematology and oncohematology but also introduced an engaging format for clinicians: pathologists and hematologists discussed real clinical cases together. For example, hematologists had the opportunity to see histological bone marrow images of patients they have been following for a long time.

Another key feature of the conference was team-based learning: within a short time, doctors were not only receiving new information but also immediately applying it in practice — analyzing, discussing possible solutions with colleagues, and working together to find common approaches to clinical challenges.

Clinical cases for discussion (and in some instances expert commentary) were presented primarily by specialists from the Hematology Center, including resident physicians. Our colleagues shared their experience with professionals from other medical institutions and, in turn, gained valuable insights. Ultimately, all of this will benefit our patients!
