Last week, our hematologists — Anton Anatolyevich Klodzinsky, PhD (Medicine), Medical Director of the Center, and Meruert Seriktaevna Sataeva, Head of the Astana division — conducted a master class at the NKR hospital as part of the mentoring program of the Kazakhstan Society of Hematologists. This was the final educational event of the annual cycle, during which Dr. Klodzinsky and Dr. Sataeva provided training and helped implement theory into daily practice.

Thanks to the mentoring program, more than 60 Kazakhstani doctors this year received training in the diagnosis and therapy of Ph-negative chronic myeloproliferative diseases, multiple myeloma, and the technique of performing bone marrow trephine biopsies. The educational course included seven mentoring programs held in five cities of Kazakhstan — Astana, Pavlodar, Kostanay, Aktobe, and Petropavlovsk. Doctors from almost all over Kazakhstan took part: Almaty, Shymkent, Aktau, Uralsk, Semey, Taldykorgan, Kyzylorda, Kokshetau, and others.

The main goal of the project was to increase the accessibility of hematological diagnostics for patients in Kazakhstan. Trephine biopsy is essential for histological examination, which is a key diagnostic tool for most hematological diseases. The ability to perform high-quality trephine biopsies in each Kazakhstani city will allow patients to undergo necessary diagnostic studies closer to home and begin treatment earlier.
