Last week, doctors from the Hematology Center — Elvira Ibraevna Tleugaleeva and Asem Anuarbekovna Spakova — received patients in the city of Balkhash.

===

Last year, new patient care formats were developed specifically for Balkhash: hybrid consultations (where a medical assistant sees the patient in person while the doctor joins online) and a mobile day hospital. The unique feature of the mobile day hospital is that hematologists from the Center travel to Balkhash every 3–4 months to provide consultations and conduct examinations, for which residents previously had to travel to Karaganda.

Elvira Ibraevna and Asem Anuarbekovna spent two days working in Balkhash. In the mornings, they received patients in the day hospital, collected samples for genetic testing and coagulation factor levels, and in the afternoons, they conducted in-person consultations. Patients were delighted to see their doctor in person (until now, they had only met online, since Elvira Ibraevna provides hybrid consultations). They were also happy that with the introduction of these new formats, they no longer have to travel to Karaganda for day hospital services — the day hospital now comes to them!
