From now on, participants themselves will be able to shape the content of our Patient Schools within the announced topics — by sending in questions in advance.
Our goal is to learn and evolve together with you — and for you!

What’s new in the format?
Previously, not only the topics of the Patient Schools were planned in advance, but also the detailed content. Experienced hematologists prepared presentations covering the causes, manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, risk factors, and lifestyle aspects of patients. In the new format, your questions will help form the internal content. Of course, our specialists will still highlight all the key points, but we plan to move away from a purely lecture-based format.

We want you to have the opportunity to ask the questions that matter most to you. From your questions, we will understand which issues require more attention. Perhaps you need detailed explanations about treatment stages or predispositions to certain diseases. Or maybe you’d like to know more about diagnostic specifics, patient lifestyle, diet, and so on.

To clarify: the School is not a substitute for an individual consultation. Please do not send personal questions about treatment choices for specific patients. Doctors’ presentations will be structured around the main submitted questions so that they are useful for the majority.

📅 The first School in the new format will be held on May 19 and will be dedicated to multiple myeloma.

📅 The next session is scheduled for June 9, focusing on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

You can send your questions in advance to patient@hemcenter.kz
 or via WhatsApp to the Patient Support Service at +7 777 079 3165.

And on May 19 and June 9, join the audience of the virtual Schools! You will get all the answers and will be able to ask additional questions during the live ZOOM conferences. Links will be published later.
