Expert in Flow Cytometry and Cryopreservation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells, E.V. Babenko, conducted a workshop for Kazakh hematologists and laboratory diagnosticians and gave positive feedback on the work of LLP “Hematology Center” branches.

Elena Vitalyevna Babenko, Head of the Department of Cryopreservation with the Laboratory for Transplant Quality Assessment at the R.M. Gorbacheva Research Institute of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology of Pavlov First Saint Petersburg State Medical University, and an internationally recognized expert, arrived in Kazakhstan at the invitation of the Public Association “Kazakhstan Society of Hematologists.”

Over a week and a half in Kazakhstan, she conducted several training events and visited the branches of LLP “Hematology Center.” The main educational event was a workshop on flow cytometry in malignant and non-malignant blood disorders, attended by hematologists and laboratory physicians. Among the participants were specialists from the National Scientific Cancer Center (Astana), the Kazakh Institute of Oncology and Radiology (Almaty), the Republican Diagnostic Center (Astana), the East Kazakhstan Consultative and Diagnostic Center, the National Scientific Cardiac Surgery Center (Astana), the Scientific Center of Pediatrics and Pediatric Surgery (Almaty), Karaganda Medical University, and all branches of LLP “Hematology Center.”

For several days, Dr. Babenko worked alongside Kazakh doctors performing flow cytometry on complex patients with malignant and non-malignant blood diseases and interpreting the results.

In addition, the invited expert delivered a lecture on immunophenotyping for the staff of the National Scientific Cancer Center and LLP “Hematology Center,” in a hybrid format with both in-person and online participation. Practicing physicians had the opportunity to engage in a live discussion and expand their knowledge of flow cytometry—a modern, highly sensitive diagnostic method also used to assess minimal residual disease, a relatively new field for Kazakhstan.

Dr. Babenko also visited all branches of LLP “Hematology Center” and gave positive feedback on their organizational system. She particularly praised the competent approach to administration. The workload taken on by administrators and the Patient Support Service—such as handling calls and organizing patient transportation for tests—frees physicians and nurses from additional tasks, allowing them to concentrate on core clinical activities and thereby improving the quality of care provided to patients.
