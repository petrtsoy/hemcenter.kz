Our specialists took an active part in the International Winter School of Hematologists. The School was organized in collaboration with the Public Association “Kazakhstan Society of Hematologists” and the Public Foundation “Kazakhstan Society of Oncohematologists.”

===

The most memorable event was the discussion club, where, using specific clinical cases, physicians discussed general issues of diagnosis and treatment approaches. Another highlight was the Young Hematologist School, in which doctors and residents fully immersed themselves in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and even cell physics. They deepened their fundamental knowledge of processes taking place in the human body, mechanisms of drug action, and their potential effects.

The event materials are available on the [website](https://www.oncohematology.kz).
