❓ What is polycythemia vera (PV)?

✳️ It is a blood cancer, one of the types of chronic leukemia, that affects the bone marrow.
The marrow produces too many blood cells — red blood cells (carrying oxygen with hemoglobin), white blood cells (protecting from infection), and platelets (stopping bleeding).

🙅‍♂️ At first glance, it may seem good to have “more of everything.” But too much is harmful: elevated blood counts cause significant problems.

❓ What problems can it cause?
✔️ Headaches, weakness, dizziness
✔️ Excessive sweating
✔️ Severe itching, especially after rubbing the skin following a warm bath or shower
✔️ Joint pain; gout may develop with severe pain in the big toe and other joints
✔️ Burning pain in hands and feet, sometimes with redness or bluish discoloration
✔️ High risk of thrombosis and bleeding (paradoxically, very high platelet counts increase bleeding risk)
✔️ Vision problems (dark spots, sparks, flashes of light)
✔️ Upper abdominal pain, early satiety due to enlarged spleen

❓ How is PV diagnosed?
✳️ Two main groups of tests:

Bone marrow biopsy (trephine biopsy)

Genetic markers, most commonly the JAK2 mutation

❓ How is PV treated?
✔️ Phlebotomy (blood removal)
✔️ Low-dose aspirin
✔️ Medications that suppress overproduction of red cells, such as:

Hydroxyurea

Interferon-alpha

Busulfan

JAK2 inhibitors (in certain cases, gradually being introduced as second-line therapy)

💊👩🏼‍⚕️ The doctor will help determine the best medication.

🔥 What else is important when choosing treatment?
🙈 The risk of clots and heart attacks is higher in smokers, people with high blood pressure, or overweight. It is important to follow your doctor’s advice on risk control.
🙊 Always mention any new symptoms or problems that occur during treatment.
🙉 Treatment involves making many decisions, such as which therapy and when.

Always share your thoughts about treatment with your doctors and nurses.
