On May 20, we lost Iskul Iskakova, a procedural nurse of the Karaganda branch of LLP “Hematology Center.” A bright person, a true professional, a reliable friend and comrade, a beloved colleague, grandmother, mother, sister, and daughter has passed away.

===

Her life was cut short far too soon by illness.

On May 16, she celebrated her 55th birthday — already in a hospital bed. But her colleagues supported her in every way: they made a touching video greeting for her, told her how much they loved her, and shared that they had postponed the celebration of International Nurses Day on May 12 until her recovery. But that day never came…

This is a bitter and painful loss. Strong, hardworking, and caring toward others, Iskul was the true foundation of her family — and of our branch as well. She had worked in hematology since 1997, standing at the very origins of the Center and the opening of its first branch. Always organized, attentive, and responsible, she never allowed mistakes. Even doctors sometimes consulted her. She dedicated herself fully to her work, even outside working hours. Colleagues from other shifts could always turn to her for advice and help. And not only they — anyone in the team could. Iskul never refused, gladly sharing her experience with younger staff. She was a mentor, telling them about the path the Center had traveled, and about the importance of valuing the conditions patients and employees enjoy today, and the care provided to them.

Calm and composed in any situation, always polite and attentive at work, outside the workplace she was also known as the soul of the company — cheerful, charming, and creative. She never raised her voice at anyone, always kind and welcoming.

This loss is heavy. But the memory of our Iskul will forever remain in the hearts of those who knew her. We extend our sincere condolences to her family and loved ones. Imandy bolsyn.
