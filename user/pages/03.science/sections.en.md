To achieve its mission, one of the strategic priorities defined by the Center is the development of scientific potential and the promotion of research in priority areas of hematology, aimed at creating high-tech innovative products that contribute to preserving and strengthening public health, as well as integrating scientific expertise, educational activities, and clinical practice.

In 2019, the Center was accredited as a subject of scientific and (or) scientific-technical activity by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Certificate No. 005567). This accreditation allows the Center to participate in grant-funded and program-targeted scientific research projects financed by the state budget and other sources.

The Center serves as a base for clinical and scientific research and their implementation in healthcare practice, as well as in the higher and professional education system. Since 2022, the Center, together with its branches and subdivisions, has been actively involved in clinical research in the field of hematology.

Scientific activities at the Center are carried out by qualified medical personnel with knowledge and skills in conducting research in accordance with international standards. The Center’s staff present their research findings at national and international scientific events and publish in leading scientific journals both in Kazakhstan and international databases.
