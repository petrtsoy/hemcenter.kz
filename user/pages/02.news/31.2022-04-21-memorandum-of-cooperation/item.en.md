LLP “Hematology Center” and the Ust-Kamenogorsk Higher Medical College have signed a Memorandum of Cooperation.
We will help each other grow stronger and join forces for the benefit of patients!

===

Building partnerships with medical educational institutions is one of the directions that LLP “Hematology Center” is consistently developing. A memorandum has already been signed with the Semey Medical College, and further cooperation with Karaganda and Temirtau is planned.

Partnership with colleges (and in the future, possibly with universities as well) is a major advantage for both the present and the future. It will provide opportunities to exchange information, improve together, and organize conferences where practicing and student nurses can deliver presentations, share interesting cases, exchange experiences, and learn from one another.

Moreover, this collaboration will help train highly qualified personnel for the branches of LLP “Hematology Center” and beyond. College students, under the framework of these memorandums, will undergo practical training at the Center’s branches, gaining firsthand experience in the nuances of hematology practice. For future healthcare workers, this “field” training will be invaluable, and for us it will provide an opportunity to meet potential employees.

During their practice, students will learn the fundamentals of patient care and medical documentation in the Medical Information System (MIS), develop skills in using educational platforms, adapt to dynamic workflow approaches in line with international standards, and participate in the implementation of new processes. In the future, the most capable graduates—those with logical thinking, empathy, a sense of responsibility, and a true passion for their work—will join us.

Together we will fight even more effectively for the health and lives of our patients. Establishing partnerships is not only about mutually beneficial cooperation, friendship, and reputation. Above all, it is about caring for the people who undergo treatment in the branches of LLP “Hematology Center.” With the signing of this memorandum, new seeds of this care have been sown.
