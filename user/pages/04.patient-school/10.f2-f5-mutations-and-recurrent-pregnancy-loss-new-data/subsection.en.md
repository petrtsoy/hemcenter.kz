The G1691A Factor V Leiden mutation (F5) and the G20210A Factor II mutation (F2) are very rare, and large-scale studies are required to clarify their role.

In a review by Xiaoling Liu et al., published on May 5, 2021, an analysis of 89 studies including more than 30,000 women was conducted.

The authors confirmed that F5 and F2 mutations increase the risk of recurrent pregnancy loss, both at early stages and, in the case of F5, to a greater extent at later stages of pregnancy.

An increased risk was also identified in women with protein S deficiency.
