This Patient School will follow an interactive format that has received enthusiastic feedback this year. We’ll begin with a short talk, “How to Take Control of Immune Thrombocytopenia,” presented by Anton Anatolyevich Klodzinsky, MD, PhD (Medicine), Medical Director of LLP “Hematology Center.” After that, we’ll move to a Q&A session. Within the announced topic, participants will be able to ask hematologists their questions and receive not only general information about the disease but also guidance relevant to specific situations.

Speakers: six physicians from LLP “Hematology Center.” Along with Medical Director Anton A. Klodzinsky, questions will be answered by Meruert Seriktaevna Sataeva, Head of the Production Base in Nur-Sultan; experienced hematologists of the Karaganda branch Natalya Vyacheslavovna Volobueva and Gulmira Alimovna Alina; and of the Ust-Kamenogorsk branch Liliya Denisovna Zablotskaya and Ayauzhan Esimbekovna Esimbekova.
