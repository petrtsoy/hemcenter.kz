The community of private clinics engaged in a direct, in-person dialogue with the Ministry of Health, the Republican Center for Health Development (RCHD), and the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF). Despite it being the weekend, the leadership teams held a full-day round of negotiations with us. The discussions focused on the rules for selecting providers of medical services within the upcoming Compulsory Social Health Insurance (CSHI) system.

Although this project had been reviewed before, we once again carefully examined its provisions, identifying risks for providers, for the Fund, and for patients. Opportunities to involve co-executors were expanded, the possibility of correcting errors in application submissions was introduced, and many other improvements were made. And you know what? The system is evolving.
