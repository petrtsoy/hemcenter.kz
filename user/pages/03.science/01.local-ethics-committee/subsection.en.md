**The Local Bioethics Committee** (LEC) at HemCenter LLP has been operating since 2019.

The LEC is an independent expert body of HemCenter LLP, composed of leading specialists in healthcare and science, representatives of medical and humanitarian professions, public organizations, and legal experts. The committee safeguards the rights, safety, and well-being of research participants and investigators and provides ethical and legal evaluation of clinical and scientific research materials at all stages — from planning to completion.

In its activities, the LEC adheres to the principles of respect for human dignity, recognition of personal autonomy, justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence towards clinical research participants, as well as to competence, collegiality, objectivity, and independence from political, administrative, departmental, collegial, or financial-economic influences.
