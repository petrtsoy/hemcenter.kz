LLP “Hematology Center” invites you to join the next Virtual Patient School!
Everyone who wants to learn more about myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera can join us on April 29 via ZOOM!

Experienced hematologists will explain what myelofibrosis is, how it manifests, discuss the causes of the disease, risk factors, lifestyle considerations for patients, as well as diagnostics and treatment at both early and advanced stages. In the second part of the School, equally detailed information will be provided about the causes and manifestations of polycythemia vera, the impact of risk factors on disease progression, and more.

For those who need guidance on how to better navigate state support programs, a talk by L.A. Akhmedyarova, President of the Republican Public Association “Association of Disabled Patients with Hemoblastoses”, will be especially useful. The topic will focus on social protection issues for people with myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.

Participants of the virtual school will not only receive valuable information but will also have the opportunity to ask the speakers questions on the announced topics.
Join us on ZOOM! Start of the School – April 29, 18:00 (Almaty time).
