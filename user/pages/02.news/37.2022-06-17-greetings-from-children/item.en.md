Twenty works were submitted to the contest, all of them truly wonderful—warm, heartfelt, and talented. The kids not only drew pictures but also made colorful 3D cards and congratulatory letters. Among the entries was even a card in the shape of a small medical kit, complete with instruments!

The children and grandchildren of employees of LLP “Hematology Center” took part in the contest. Six participants will receive prizes. Three of them became winners based on voting results on Instagram. The leading work by 9-year-old Azhar Shombina received an impressive 459 votes, the drawing by 11-year-old Liza Lvova gathered 317 votes, and the youngest participant, 5-year-old Inkar Shombina, collected 304 likes! All three winners are from Ust-Kamenogorsk, and they will receive the main contest prizes.

Additionally, three works selected by the LLP “Hematology Center” jury will also be awarded: the charismatic doctor drawn by 7-year-old Nurislam Dalabay (Karaganda), the bright and peaceful sun-themed card by 8-year-old Ramazan Yeraly (Karaganda), and the conceptual card by 14-year-old Diana Yakovenko (Ust-Kamenogorsk).

A huge thank-you to all participants for your creativity, dedication, and talent! And especially—for the brightest congratulations!
Happy upcoming holiday, dear colleagues! Wishing you health and happiness!
