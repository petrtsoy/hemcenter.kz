Hematology Center has developed a new consultation format for residents of Balkhash.

===

This format, which combines in-person visits with online video, is conditionally called a hybrid consultation. Its introduction will help residents of the region with hematological diseases continue receiving treatment locally.

In the new format, patients will be seen in person by a physician assistant—a specialist with paramedical training who has undergone special preparation at the Karaganda branch of the Hematology Center. The assistant will complete the documentation, collect additional information required for the examination, and connect the physician online via video call. The patient will be able to speak with the doctor and ask questions. The assistant will conduct a physical examination and provide data on the patient’s somatic status. Based on this, the physician will prepare a medical conclusion (with the possibility for the patient to clarify any unclear points), which the assistant will then hand over in paper form, with a signature and stamp.

Consultations in Balkhash will be carried out by Dr. Makpal Sertayevna Abylkhalimova (Instagram: @dr.gematolog
