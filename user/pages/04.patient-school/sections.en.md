The Patient School was created to provide everyone affected by blood disorders with reliable and easy-to-understand information about their health. On this page you will find video lectures, articles, and practical materials prepared by specialists of the Hematology Center and partner organizations.

Key topics include pregnancy and hematological risks, thrombophilia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myeloid leukemia, anemia, and other blood disorders.

The goal of the school is to help patients and their families better understand the specifics of the disease, learn about treatment and prevention methods, and improve their quality of life.
