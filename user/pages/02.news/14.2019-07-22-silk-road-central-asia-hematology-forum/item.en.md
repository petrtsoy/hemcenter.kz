The development of hematology care, the improvement of diagnostic methods, the enhancement of treatment effectiveness, and the conduct of cooperative scientific research are impossible without international collaboration.

In recent decades, oncohematology — and in particular haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CAR-T therapy, and other cellular and genetic technologies — has been rapidly advancing in China. In these high-tech areas, our closest neighbor is emerging as a world leader.

The forum provided a unique opportunity not only to share information about the state of hematology services in Kazakhstan but also to discuss a wide range of issues, including possibilities for joint scientific research, training (including nursing education), remote consultations on complex clinical cases, transfer of medical technologies, and prospects for cooperation at all levels: medical associations, clinics and centers, physicians, and nurses.

On the Chinese side, the dialogue involved leading experts in oncohematology, transplantation, and cell therapy, including Professor Kaiyan Liu, Professor He Huang, Professor Ming Jiang, and others.
