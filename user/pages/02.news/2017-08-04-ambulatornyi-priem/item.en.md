Since August 4, 2017, the Hematology Center has been providing outpatient consultations at its Ust-Kamenogorsk Department for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment strategy planning.

During a single visit, a patient can both receive a doctor’s consultation and undergo necessary procedures such as sternal puncture and trephine biopsy. In addition, the Center has all the resources required for conducting molecular genetic, cytogenetic, immunohistochemical, and other tests, as well as offering review of paraffin blocks in leading laboratories in Moscow.
